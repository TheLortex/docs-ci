The primary use of epoch is to trim the directories that exist in `prep` and `compile` that are no longer linked from an `epoch-*`. These directories can accumulate many Gb of data, causing ocaml-docs-ci pipelines to fail with not enough disk space.

Running the tests should delete orphan universes and leave linked universe alone:
```sh
$ ./run
Creating linked universe bf6f7d00b40806e7dd74ad1828a0aa6d
