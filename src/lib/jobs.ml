    [ o o x o x o o o ] 3 [ o o o x x x x x ] 4 [ o x x x o x x x ]

    1) Sort by decreasing universe size, and create a new job as long as there
    is some useful package. 2) For each job, sort by increasing universe size
    and set `prep` as the never previously encountered packages in the universe. *)
